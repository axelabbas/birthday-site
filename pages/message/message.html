            <span>For my beloved.</span>

            Today is not just a normal day,
            Today the entire globe was blessed with you.
            The day the cosmos whispered your name into existence for the first time,
            The day my favorite soul graced this world with its first breath
            I love you in a way that no words can ever truly capture.

            These feelings are deeper than language,
            Something that lingers in the spaces between every heartbeat,
            in the quiet moments when the world melts away,
            all that remains is you.

            From the moment I saw you, my heart quivered,
            as if it had spent a lifetime searching, roaming,
            only to finally come home.
            Something inside me shifted, settled,
            like the missing piece of a narrative I never realized I was writing or needed to write,

            The way you smile, Oh God, it makes me feel high,
            as if nothing else matters,
            as if I could float forever in the warmth of it.

            And oh your voice…
            it's tranquility, pure and simple.
            The kind that settles deep in my soul,
            calming every storm, quieting every fear.

            Your eyes, -those eyes-
            they leave me breathless.
            They hold a brightness that swallows me,
            pulling me in, drowning me in something so pure,
            so consuming, that I never want to come up for air again.

            And your hair, in every form it takes,
            messy or neat, damp or windswept-
            it beckons to me.
            My fingers ache to run through it,
            to trace every strand like a map leading me back to you.

            The way you sleep, the way you eat,
            the way you just… exist.
            Every little thing about you is something I want to hold onto,
            to hold dear, to remember.

            Even the flaws you think you have
            to me, they scarcely exist.
            And if they do, I love them too,
            because they are part of you.
            You arouse in me feelings I never would have known I could have.
            You teach me new emotions, depths of love, and hues of serenity.
            Every piece of my soul that is touched by you
            becomes something better.

            So today, on your special day,
            I revel in your existence
            Not just the day you were born,
            but every single moment that has led you here,
            every little piece of you that makes you, you.
            I love everything about you.
            I love everything related to you.
            And I cannot be more thankful,
            because in this vast universe,
            I found you
            the most beautiful and pure soul to ever exist.


            <span>Happy Birthday, my love, my brightest star, my forever.</span>
